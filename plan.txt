Generate an API using Fast API and pydantic

This API should have 1 endpoint called /chat

This endpoint should take a message from a user and will forward it to a RAG Agent that we are building with LangChain and OpenAI

Load the OpenAI Key using dotenv

The data that needs to be read into the Knowledge Base is in the __mocks__ folder in JSON format. 

Use langchain and JSONLoader and jq to process the large json files. Batch where necessary.

Create and Agent associated with our Knowledge Base Documents and query the knowledge base for the user input.
