## Technical Implementation Details

### Knowledge Base Processing and Optimization

I designed the system to prioritize the most recent information, recognizing that in financial markets, recency is a critical factor in decision-making. My implementation includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Temporal Prioritization** - I built a custom re-ranking algorithm that weights documents by their timestamp, ensuring tweets and market commentary from the last 24-48 hours receive higher priority in the retrieval process. This temporal relevance ensures portfolio managers always see the latest market movements reflected in their trading theses.

2. **Multiprocessing Pipeline** - To handle the volume of financial data efficiently, I implemented a parallel processing architecture using Python's multiprocessing library. This approach divides the document processing workload across multiple CPU cores, achieving up to 4x faster indexing compared to sequential processing.

3. **Persistence and Fast Startup** - I implemented a sophisticated knowledge base serialization system:
   - After initial processing, the FAISS index and document metadata are pickled to disk
   - On container restart, the system detects and loads these pre-built artifacts
   - This reduced container startup time from ~90 seconds to under 10 seconds
   - Each container maintains its own local copy of the knowledge base for reliability

4. **Incremental Updates** - Rather than rebuilding the entire knowledge base for new data, I created an incremental update system that:
   - Processes only new tweets and documents since the last update
   - Merges new vectors into the existing FAISS index
   - Updates metadata storage with new document information
   - Runs on a scheduled basis to ensure fresh data without full reprocessing

This optimization approach enables near-instant deployment transitions with zero downtime, as new containers can quickly load the serialized knowledge base and begin serving requests while old containers are gracefully terminated.
