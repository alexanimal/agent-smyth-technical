# Trading Ideas Microservice: Implementation Strategy

## Objective

Develop a microservice to generate trading ideas (long/short) for a $50 billion AUM long/short equity hedge fund portfolio manager, leveraging provided data feeds as a mini-world that captures trading signals.

## System Architecture

My implementation follows a modern microservice architecture with the following key components:

1. **RAG Knowledge Engine** - Core system for retrieving and synthesizing relevant financial insights
2. **API Layer** - FastAPI-based interface for query submission and response handling
3. **Containerized Deployment** - AWS ECS/Fargate deployment for scalability and reliability
4. **LLM Integration** - Leveraging state-of-the-art OpenAI models for analysis

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance API development
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK for automated deployment
- **RAG Framework**: LangChain for orchestrating retrieval and generation
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Cloud Services**: AWS ECS (Fargate), API Gateway, Network Load Balancer
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation Implementation

My RAG system follows a multi-stage process to generate high-quality trading ideas:

1. **Query Classification** - Categorize incoming queries into types (investment, technical, trading_thesis, general)
2. **Knowledge Retrieval** - Fetch relevant documents from the vector store based on query type
3. **Temporal Re-ranking** - Prioritize recent financial information (crucial for market relevance)
4. **Context Formation** - Synthesize retrieved documents into a coherent context
5. **Prompt Selection** - Choose specialized prompts based on query classification
6. **LLM Inference** - Generate nuanced trading theses with the specialized model
7. **Source Attribution** - Provide transparency by citing information sources

## Query Classification System

I implemented a query classification system that routes questions to specialized handlers:

- **Investment Queries** - Financial analysis focused on long-term value
- **Trading Thesis Queries** - Comprehensive trading ideas with entry/exit points
- **Technical Analysis Queries** - Chart patterns and technical indicator analysis
- **General Queries** - Broad market information and factual responses

This classification ensures that each query receives the most appropriate analytical treatment.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Knowledge Base Processing

The processing pipeline includes:
1. Data ingestion and cleaning
2. Text chunking for optimal retrieval
3. Embedding generation using OpenAI's embedding models
4. Vector storage in FAISS for efficient similarity search

### Deployment Architecture

I deployed the service using AWS CDK with the following components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│  API Gateway    │────▶│  Network Load    │────▶│  ECS Fargate  │
│                 │     │  Balancer (TCP)  │     │  Service      │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └───────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                                 ┌───────────────┐
                                                 │  Knowledge    │
                                                 │  Base (FAISS) │
                                                 └───────────────┘
```

Key deployment features:
- Containerized application for consistency across environments
- Zero-downtime deployments with min_healthy_percent=100
- Health check monitoring for system reliability
- Automatic scaling capabilities based on demand

### Health Monitoring and Reliability

I implemented several features to ensure system reliability:
- TCP health checks for container health monitoring
- Grace period configuration for proper initialization
- Sentry integration for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Structured logging for debugging and analysis

## Results and Performance

The system achieves:
- Sub-second response times for most queries
- High-quality trading theses with supporting evidence
- Reliable operation during market hours
- Seamless updates without service interruption

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Data Integration** - Connect to live market data feeds
2. **Backtesting Module** - Test trading ideas against historical performance
3. **Sentiment Analysis** - Incorporate market sentiment into trading theses
4. **Portfolio Integration** - Provide ideas in context of existing portfolio positions
5. **Multi-Modal Analysis** - Incorporate chart image analysis for technical patterns

## Conclusion

Agent Smyth represents a sophisticated application of RAG technology to financial market analysis. By combining state-of-the-art language models with domain-specific knowledge retrieval and a robust deployment architecture, I've created a powerful tool for hedge fund managers to generate and evaluate trading ideas backed by contextual market knowledge.

The system demonstrates how AI can augment financial expertise, not by replacing human judgment, but by surfacing relevant information and generating nuanced analyses that portfolio managers can evaluate and act upon.
