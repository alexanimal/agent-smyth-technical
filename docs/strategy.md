# Trading Ideas Microservice: Implementation Strategy

## Objective

Develop a microservice to generate trading ideas (long/short) for a $50 billion AUM long/short equity hedge fund portfolio manager, leveraging provided data feeds as a mini-world that captures trading signals.

## System Architecture

My implementation follows a modern microservice architecture with the following key components:

1. **RAG Knowledge Engine** - Core system for retrieving and synthesizing relevant financial insights
2. **API Layer** - FastAPI-based interface for query submission and response handling
3. **Containerized Deployment** - AWS ECS/Fargate deployment for scalability and reliability
4. **LLM Integration** - Leveraging state-of-the-art OpenAI models for analysis

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance API development
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK for automated deployment
- **RAG Framework**: LangChain for orchestrating retrieval and generation
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Cloud Services**: AWS ECS (Fargate), API Gateway, Network Load Balancer
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation Implementation

My RAG system follows a multi-stage process to generate high-quality trading ideas:

1. **Query Classification** - Categorize incoming queries into types (investment, technical, trading_thesis, general)
2. **Knowledge Retrieval** - Fetch relevant documents from the vector store based on query type
3. **Temporal Re-ranking** - Prioritize recent financial information (crucial for market relevance)
4. **Context Formation** - Synthesize retrieved documents into a coherent context
5. **Prompt Selection** - Choose specialized prompts based on query classification
6. **LLM Inference** - Generate nuanced trading theses with the specialized model
7. **Source Attribution** - Provide transparency by citing information sources

## Query Classification System

I implemented a query classification system that routes questions to specialized handlers:

- **Investment Queries** - Financial analysis focused on long-term value
- **Trading Thesis Queries** - Comprehensive trading ideas with entry/exit points
- **Technical Analysis Queries** - Chart patterns and technical indicator analysis
- **General Queries** - Broad market information and factual responses

This classification ensures that each query receives the most appropriate analytical treatment.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Knowledge Base Processing

The processing pipeline includes:
1. Data ingestion and cleaning
2. Text chunking for optimal retrieval
3. Embedding generation using OpenAI's embedding models
4. Vector storage in FAISS for efficient similarity search

### Deployment Architecture

I deployed the service using AWS CDK with the following components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│  API Gateway    │────▶│  Network Load    │────▶│  ECS Fargate  │
│                 │     │  Balancer (TCP)  │     │  Service      │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └───────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                                 ┌───────────────┐
                                                 │  Knowledge    │
                                                 │  Base (FAISS) │
                                                 └───────────────┘
```

Key deployment features:
- Containerized application for consistency across environments
- Zero-downtime deployments with min_healthy_percent=100
- Health check monitoring for system reliability
- Automatic scaling capabilities based on demand

### Health Monitoring and Reliability

I implemented several features to ensure system reliability:
- TCP health checks for container health monitoring
- Grace period configuration for proper initialization
- Sentry integration for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Structured logging for debugging and analysis

This screenshot shows our Github Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and prepares the application for deployment. The workflow includes automated unit tests, integration tests, and security scanning to ensure code quality and reliability before deployment.

### Continuous Deployment

The Sentry dashboard provides real-time visibility into application errors and exceptions. This allows us to quickly identify and resolve issues that might affect the quality of trading recommendations.

### Performance Monitoring
